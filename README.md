# Head-motion-control-wheelchair
A head-motion and voice controlled automatic wheelchair serves the mobility requirements of quadriplegics. It detects head motion using data obtained from ADXL 335, a triple axis accelerometer. The data is processed using two microcontrollers, ATMega-2560, and Genuino-Uno, programmed to work with the open-source platform, Arduino. The wheelchair moves in three directions, i.e., front, right, and left, based on the user’s head motions. The Arduino controls motors in the desired direction. An ultrasonic sensor prevents collisions with obstacles and enhances user safety.  Data is transferred from the accelerometer placed on the user’s head to the receiver for data processing using RF technology. We also explore the advantages of implementing offline voice control, a staircase climbing wheelchair and brain-wave controlled wheelchair.
